# The Idea of a Computer as the Internet and the Browser as the OS

## **Historical Context:**
This idea has roots in the early days of networked computing, but it gained significant traction with the
advent of Web 2.0 and cloud computing. Companies like Google were early proponents, with initiatives
like Chrome OS pushing the boundaries of what could be done entirely within a browser. Additionally, the
GNU created by Richard Stallman which revolutionized how we interact with operating systems can be
considered in this idea as bringing GNU to the 21st century through browsers.

## Ecosystems and Apple
The development of Apple's Safari is part of this vision. Safari was created as a browser that could use multiple search engines, but Apple had control of it themselves. Instead of placing everything in the browser, Apple made users download apps, because they would run more natively with the hardware and operating system. Thus, apps could run far better using the hardware and operating system set forth by Apple instead of using Safari, which would have to conform to web technologies and not built in hardware on the phone, which would not run as natively. Apple may have also created apps and used the App Store to gain revenue with a more controlled ecosystem. Ecosystems are often created by large companies and can trap customers in "siloes". Instead of using the browser, Apple, Google, and other companies created their own ecosystems that get customers stuck in their ecosystem, because these people have limited knowledge of other ecosystems. Not all ecosystems offer the same features, so a user cannot get all the features they want from one ecosystem, so they might have to stick with one for certain features, but not all. The history of apps and browsers also stems from ecosystems, as companies like Apple saw the opportunity to create an ecosystem that represents the Apple device instead of using web-based and cross-platform solutions. Creating such ecosystems allows for customer lock-in and quality control of their own brand.

## **Cloud Computing's Role:**
Cloud services have been instrumental in realizing this vision. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS),
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) models have made it possible to offload
computation, storage, and entire applications to the cloud. This shift has transformed the internet from a
mere communication network into a global computational resource.
However, this model creates a tension between centralized platforms and the decentralized nature of browser-based solutions. While cloud services provide convenience and power, they often lead to reliance on a few dominant providers (like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure), which can result in vendor lock-in and reduced user control over data and services.
In contrast, using a browser-centric approach promotes decentralization, allowing users to access a wide variety of web applications without being tied to specific platforms. This flexibility can encourage innovation and diversity in software offerings. Yet, the trade-off is that web applications might not always leverage the same level of performance and integration that native apps or cloud-hosted applications can provide.

Definitions: IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, PaaS offers a platform for building and deploying applications, and SaaS delivers fully functional software applications via the cloud.

## **Browser Evolution:**
Modern browsers have become sophisticated platforms in their own right. They now support:

● Complex JavaScript engines for high-performance code execution

● WebAssembly for near-native performance

● APIs for accessing device hardware (e.g., camera, GPS, accelerometer)

● Local storage and IndexedDB for offline capabilities

● WebGL for 3D graphics

● Web Workers for multi-threading

## **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs):**
How are PWAs related to “making the browser an OS”?
- PWAs exemplify the "internet as a computer and the browser as an operating system" by
enabling web apps to function like native apps, offering offline capabilities, installation, and
system-like performance directly through the browser.
What are their capabilities right now?
● [Browser-based computing] (https://catalyit.com/cloud-software-browser-vs-desktop-applications/)

● Offline functionality

● Push notifications

● Home screen installation

● App-like interfaces and interactions

## **Web-based Development Environments:**
The rise of browser-based IDEs like GitHub Codespaces, Replit, and CodeSandbox demonstrates how
even software development can be moved entirely to the web.
- GitHub Codespaces: run full-fledged development environments in the cloud, coding, testing,
deployment entirely through the browser
- Replit: provides an in-browser coding platform with real-time collaboration, supporting
multi-language development directly on the web
- CodeSandbox: online development environment for front-end and full-stack projects, allowing
instant previews and sharing within the browser

## **Impact on Hardware:**
● Thin clients and Chromebook-like devices become more viable

● The importance of local storage and processing power may diminish

● Network connectivity becomes even more critical
